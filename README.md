# Smart Battery Management for Laptops

A Laptop Battery Management solution that interfaces with tp-link's series of Smart Home Plugs to enable or disable charging in a certain range of charge.

You will need to edit the two batch files to match your own deviceID and token before this program will work.

REQUIRES A FEW ITEMS TO MAKE WORK:

- tp-link Smart Plug
(tested with hs105, not guaranteed to work with others, but you may as well try)

- An active internet connection
(used to connect to tp-link's servers to manage requests to the smart plug)

You will need your own deviceID and token to interface with your smart plug.
